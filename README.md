## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## Deploy on other Hosting Options

In your own hosting provider, run the build script once, which builds the production application in the .next folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

After building, the start script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API Routes.

```bash
npm run start
```

<b>If you want static file, run the deploy script once, which builds the production application in the out folder.<b>

```bash
npm run deploy
```
